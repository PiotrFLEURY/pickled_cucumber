# ü•í Pickled cucumber ü•í

A simple Dart engine for Cucumber scenarios.

Works with **[üéØ Dart](#dart-usage)**, **[üê∏ Dart Frog](#dart-frog-usage)** and **[üê¶ Flutter](#flutter-usage)** projects.

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Note:**
>
> This is a non official package, not affiliated with the Cucumber nor the Dart project.
>
> The goal of this project is to provide a simple way to run Cucumber scenarios in Dart and Flutter projects.
>
> This project does not aim to be a full Cucumber implementation. It only supports the most common features of Cucumber.

## Getting started

Add it to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```bash
dart pub add pickled_cucumber
```

or add it manually:

```yaml
dependencies:
  pickled_cucumber: ^1.0.0 # use the latest version
```

## Features

### Background Steps

Pickled Cucumber supports **Background** steps, which are common steps that run before each scenario in a feature file. This powerful feature allows you to:

- **Eliminate code duplication**: Define common setup steps once instead of repeating them in every scenario
- **Improve test readability**: Keep scenarios focused on their specific logic by moving setup to the background
- **Ensure consistent test state**: All scenarios start from the same well-defined initial state
- **Simplify maintenance**: Update common setup logic in one place

#### Syntax

```gherkin
Feature: User Management

  Background:
    Given the application is running
    And I am logged in as an administrator
    And I navigate to the user management page

  Scenario: Create new user
    When I click on "Add User" button
    And I fill in the user form
    Then a new user should be created

  Scenario: Delete existing user
    When I select an existing user
    And I click on "Delete" button
    Then the user should be removed from the list
```

#### How it works

1. **Execution order**: For each scenario, Pickled Cucumber first executes all steps defined in the `Background` section, then executes the scenario's own steps
2. **Isolation**: Each scenario gets a fresh execution of the background steps, ensuring test isolation
3. **Inheritance**: All scenarios in the same feature file automatically inherit the background steps

## Usage

### Dart usage

Write your first feature file in any directory

```gherkin
# features/counter.feature

Feature: Counter

  Scenario: Increment counter
    Given a variable set to 1
    When I increment the variable by 1
    Then the variable should contain 2
```

Create your Dart step definitions file

```dart
// features/step_definitions/counter_steps.dart
class CounterStepDefs {

    int _counter;
    
    @Given("a variable set to {int}")
    void aVariableIsSetTo(int value) {
        _counter = value;
    }
    
    @When("I increment the variable by {int}")
    void iIncrementTheVariableBy(int value) {
        _counter += value;
    }

    @Then("the variable should contain {int}")
    void theVariableShouldContain(int value) {
        expect(_counter, value);
    }
}
```

Create your entry point in `test` directory

```dart
// test/cucumber_test.dart
import 'package:pickled_cucumber/pickled_cucumber.dart';
import 'package:counter/features/step_definitions/counter_steps.dart';

void main() {
    final stepDefsDartFile = CounterStepDefs();

    PickledCucumber.runFeatures(
        "features/counter.feature",
        stepDefsDartFile,
    );
}
```

Run your tests

```bash
dart test test/cucumber_test.dart
```

### Dart Frog usage

Pickled cucumber works the exact same way as Dart with Dart Frog.

Write your first feature file in any directory

```gherkin
# test/features/index.feature
Feature: index

    Scenario: GET index route
        Given my app is running
        When I visit the index route
        Then I should see "Welcome to Dart Frog!"
        And receive a 200 status code
```

Create your Dart Frog step definitions file

```dart
// test/step_definitions.dart
import 'package:pickled_cucumber/pickled_cucumber.dart';
import 'package:dart_frog/dart_frog.dart';
import 'package:mocktail/mocktail.dart' as mocktail;
import 'package:test/test.dart';
import '../routes/index.dart' as route;

class MockRequestContext extends mocktail.Mock implements RequestContext {}

class DartFrogStepDefinition {
  late MockRequestContext context;
  Response? response;

  @Given('my app is running')
  void myAppIsRunning() {
    context = MockRequestContext();
  }

  @When('I visit the index route')
  void iVisitTheIndexRoute() {
    response = route.onRequest(context);
  }

  @Then('I should see {string}')
  Future<void> iShouldSee(String string) async {
    expect(response!.body(), completion(equals(string)));
  }

  @And('receive a {int} status code')
  void receiveStatusCode(int statusCode) {
    expect(response!.statusCode, equals(statusCode));
  }
}

```

Create your entry point in `test` directory

```dart
// test/cucumber_test.dart
import 'package:pickled_cucumber/pickled_cucumber.dart';

import 'step_definitions.dart';

void main() {
  PickledCucumber().runFeatures(
    'test/features/',
    DartFrogStepDefinition(),
  );
}

```

### Flutter usage

With Pickled cucumber, you can make [Flutter integration tests](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/integration/introduction) and [Widget tests](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/widget/introduction) using Cucumber scenarios.

Pickled cucumber works with code generation for Flutter projects.

Please add `build_runner` dependency to your project

```bash
flutter pub add dev:build_runner
```

Write your first feature file in `test/features` directory

```gherkin
# test/features/counter.feature

Feature: counter
    counter should increment

    Scenario: increment counter
      Given counter is 0
      When I increment counter
      Then counter should be 1
```

Create your Dart step definitions file in `test/` directory

> ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: only import annotations ‚ö†Ô∏è

```dart
// test/counter_steps.dart

// IMPORTANT: ‚ö†Ô∏è only import annotations ‚ö†Ô∏è
import 'package:pickled_cucumber/src/annotations.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_example/main.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

@StepDefinition()
class CounterSteps {

  @Given('counter is {int}')
  Future<void> counterIs(WidgetTester tester, int counter) async {
    debugPrint('counter is $counter');
    await tester.pumpWidget(const MyApp());

    expect(find.text('$counter'), findsOneWidget);
  }

  @When('I increment counter')
  Future<void> iIncrementCounter(
    WidgetTester tester,
  ) async {
    debugPrint('I increment counter');

    await tester.tap(find.byIcon(Icons.add));
    await tester.pumpAndSettle();
  }

  @Then('counter should be {int}')
  Future<void> counterShouldBe(WidgetTester tester, int counter) async {
    debugPrint('counter should be $counter');

    expect(find.text('$counter'), findsOneWidget);
  }
}

```

Run `build_runner` to generate the step definitions file

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Create your entry point in `test` directory

```dart
// test/cucumber_test.dart
import 'counter_steps.pickled.dart';

main() => runFeatures();
```

#### Run your tests as Widget tests

```bash
flutter test test/cucumber_test.dart
# or
flutter test
```

#### Run your tests as Integration tests

Create your entry point in `integration_test` directory

```dart
// integration_test/app_test.dart
import 'package:integration_test/integration_test.dart';

import '../test/counter_step_definitions.g.dart';

void main() {
  IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  runFeatures();
}
```

Run your tests

```bash
flutter test integration_test/app_test.dart
```
